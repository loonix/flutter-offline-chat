# Flutter Offline Chat

NOTE: This project is under development, I haven't fully tested this concept. Please feel free to contribute.

Using SocketServer Dart Class to manipulate TCP Sockets.

Its just a simple test to see how far I can get offline mode to go.

PS: I am just tired of being online, that's all :)
